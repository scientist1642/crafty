## General

The app is scaffolded using create `Create React Native App` and can be run
by the command `npx react-native run-ios/android`


## Used Libraries

Since the scope of the app is rather limited, we could get away without using some of those libraries listed,
But since they are quite useful in larger apps, It was worth to refresh the installation process.

* `react-native-vector-icons`
* `react-navigation`
* `react-native-charts-wrapper`
